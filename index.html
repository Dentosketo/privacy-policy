        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Qityol Lite ("we", "our", "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains
            how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>1. Camera Access</h3>
        <p>We request access to your device's camera <strong>solely to allow you to scan ISBN barcodes</strong> when
            adding or identifying books. We do not store or process any images captured by your camera.</p>

        <h3>2. Microphone Access</h3>
        <p>We request microphone permission <strong>so you can use voice search</strong> to search for books,
            audiobooks, or podcasts. Voice data is processed in real-time and not stored on our servers.</p>

        <h3>3. Location Access</h3>
        <p>We use your approximate or precise location <strong>to show nearby bookclubs</strong> and improve
            community-based recommendations. Location is never shared with third parties.</p>

        <h3>4. SMS and Messaging Access</h3>
        <p>By using our platform(s)"Qityol Mobility" "Qityol Lite" "Heart and Home AFH LLC" "TheVillage", you agree to these terms. We collect and use your mobile phone number <strong>solely for account verification and security</strong>. We send one-time verification codes (OTP) via text message to confirm your identity during sign-up or login. Your phone number is not used for marketing purposes.</p>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <ul>

            <li>To improve app performance and user experience</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Storage & Security</h2>
        <p>We do not store camera or microphone data. Location data is used temporarily and never saved permanently. All
            other app data, including verification numbers, is securely stored using industry-standard encryption.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Qityol Lite may use third-party services such as Firebase, Supabase, or Twilio. These services may
            collect necessary data to help us provide authentication and improve the app.</p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You may revoke camera, microphone, location, or messaging permissions at any time from your device settings. Some
            features may stop working without these permissions.</p>
